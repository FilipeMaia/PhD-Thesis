\chapter{Image Reconstruction}\label{Image Reconstruction}\noindent

In the previous chapter we have developed tools that allow us to predict
and calculate the X-ray diffraction pattern from an arbitrary electron density,
using mild assumptions. In this chapter we will try to tackle the {\em inverse
  problem}, that is, from an arbitrary diffraction pattern we will try to
recover the electron density that gave rise to it.
\section{The Phase Problem}

We have seen that a diffraction pattern can be calculated from the Fourier
transform of the electron density. We have also seen in chapter
\ref{fourier_transform_basics} that the inverse of the Fourier transform is
exactly like the Fourier transform, except with the sign of the exponent
swapped. So we should be able to recover the electron density by,
\begin{equation}
\rho(\mathbf r) = \int_{\mathbf r} F(\mathbf S) \exp\left(-2
    \pi i \mathbf r \cdot \mathbf S \right) d\mathbf S\, .
\end{equation}

In general $F(\mathbf S)$ is a complex number and unfortunately it is not
possible to measure $F(\mathbf S)$, but only its absolute value, also known as
amplitude. The phase, also known as the argument of $F(\mathbf S)$, is not known and so
this problem is often called the {\em phase problem}. One could try to reconstruct the
object assuming that the phases have an arbitrary value, say 0, and use the
experimental intensities but this usually gives an uninterpretable picture. On
the other hand if the phases were known and the amplitudes unknown, then the
resulting picture is still quite similar to the original, suggesting that the
phases carry more structural information than the amplitudes (see Fig. \ref{Fig:PhaseSwapping}).

\end{figure}

If nothing about the object being imaged is known then the problem is
undetermined, as for a pattern with $N$ pixels we have $2N$ unknowns (the real and
imaginary part of the object) but only $N$ constraints. But if we known that the object is isolated, meaning the
object is surrounded by a constant $\rho$ (e.g., sample in vacuum where
surrounding $\rho = 0$), then in some circunstances it is possible to solve this
problem. The number of pixels of the object must at least be half of that of the
diffraction pattern for the number of unknowns match the number of
constraints, that is the oversampling ratio (see Fig. \ref{Fig:OversamplingRatio}) of the image must be bigger than
two, or equivalently the object must occupy less than half of the field of
view. We will call images which fullfill this condition {\em oversampled}.

But this is not enough being able to solve the problem. In fact it
has long been known that the problem is often undetermined in one dimension
\cite{Walther63}. Fortunately for higher dimensions is has been proven it has
been proven that most oversampled patterns have unique solutions
\cite{Bruck79}. This difference derives from the fact that one-dimensional
polynomials are factorizable unlike two or higher dimension ones.

\section{Image Reconstruction Algorithms}

Knowing that the two or higher dimensional phasing problem for oversampled
patterns has a unique solution in most cases is a necessary starting point to
solve the phase problem, but a method to find that unique solution is still
necessary. The phase problem is remarkably difficult since it is neither a
linear nor a convex problem. That makes it a nonconvex problem in a very high
dimensional space, which is a class of problems that is very challenging.

\begin{figure}[h]

    (c) optimization problems.}
  \label{Fig:Convexity}
\end{figure}

In 1972 Gerchberg and Saxton \cite{Gerchberg72} introduced an iterative algorithm to solve
a related problem, that of obtaining phase information using both the
diffraction pattern and an electron micrograph of a sample. The iteration starts
by fourier transforming the real space input, $\rho_i(\mathbf x)$. Then it
replaces the resulting amplitudes with the square root of the intensities,
$I(\mathbf S)$. The result is then back fourier transformed and the amplitudes
of the resulting images are replaced by the ones from the electron micrograph $M(\mathbf r)$.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Gerchberg-Saxton Iteration}
\begin{algorithmic}
  \STATE $F_{i}(\mathbf S) \gets \mathscr{F}\{\rho_i(\mathbf r)\}$
  \STATE $F_{i+1}(\mathbf S) \gets \sqrt{I(\mathbf S)} \frac{F_i(\mathbf S)}{|F_i(\mathbf S)|}$
  \STATE $\rho_{i+1}(\mathbf r) \gets M(\mathbf r)
  \frac{\mathscr{F}^{-1}\{F_{i+1}(\mathbf
    S)\}}{|\mathscr{F}^{-1}\{F_{i+1}(\mathbf S)\}|}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In 1978 Fienup \cite{Fienup78}, inspired by the above algorithm, introduced the error
reduction algorithm to solve the phasing problem. Instead of using the electron
micrograph as constraints in real space Fienup introduces the concept of {\em
  support} function, $\Pi(\mathbf r)$, which is equal to 1 where the
object is allowed the reside and 0 otherwise. 
The iteration is analogue to the Gerchberg-Saxton but the last step is replaced
by setting all points outside the support to 0.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Error Reduction Iteration}
\begin{algorithmic}
  \STATE $F_{i}(\mathbf S) \gets \mathscr{F}\{\rho_i(\mathbf r)\}$
  \STATE $F_{i+1}(\mathbf S) \gets \sqrt{I(\mathbf S)} \frac{F_i(\mathbf S)}{|F_i(\mathbf S)|}$
  \STATE $\rho_{i+1}(\mathbf r) \gets \Pi(\mathbf r) \mathscr{F}^{-1}\{F_{i+1}(\mathbf S)\}$
%  \STATE $i = 0$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

By applying this procedure iteratively it is possible to recover the correct
solution. Unfortunately in practise the algorithm easily gets stuck in
local minima and cannot find the global minimum.

\subsection{Iterations as Projections}

In 1984 Levi and Stark realized that the above iterations can be
interpreted as projections in Hilbert space \cite{Levi84}. This provides a
particularly powerful method for trying to understand these algorithms.
Lets call the replacement of the fourier space amplitudes with the square root of
the intensities the modulus projection, $P_m$, and the replacement of the image
outside of the support with 0 the support projection, $P_s$. If one treats the
real space image as a vector in a high dimensional space, with one dimension per
pixel, then it is easy to see that $P_s$ is the projection into the hyperplane
spanned by the dimensions corresponding to pixels inside the support. The
modulus projection can also be interpreted as a projection in the space of the
pixels of the diffraction pattern, where each pixel contributes two dimensions,
the real part and the imaginary part (see Fig. \ref{Fig:Projections}). 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1 \columnwidth]{Image_Reconstruction/projections.png}
  \caption{{\bf a)} Support projection for a 3 pixel image where the support is
    composed of pixels 2 and 3. {\bf b)} Modulus projection for 1 pixel of the
    diffraction pattern.}
  \label{Fig:Projections}
\end{figure}

Due to the distance preserving property of the Fourier transform the modulus
projection is also a projection in real space. The biggest difference between
the two projection is that while the support constraint set is convex, the
modulus constraint is not, not all points between two points of the modulus
constraint set belong to the modulus constraint set.
