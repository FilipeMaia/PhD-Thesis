\chapter{New Ultrashort X-ray Sources}\label{Ultrashort X-ray Sources}\noindent
 

- History of the development of X-ray sources

- overview of the light sources used and for which possible applications are developed

* X-ray Free Electron Lasers

- Not as a substitute for the synchrotron but as a complement
- Single experimental station compared a ring
- Many orders of magnitude improvement over third generation synchrotrons
- How an FEL works (discuss wigglers, undulators and finally SASE undulators)


* FLASH in Hamburg 

- First soft X-ray FEL
- 20 um focal spot 15fs 7.0nm wavelength (magnus reference 3)

* High Harmonic Generation

- Started one decade ago
- Short description with non linear effects
- Show some scheme of the setup
- Very short pulse lengths
-
