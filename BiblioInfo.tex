% The advent of X-ray lasers provides the scientific community with a
% new kind of instrument that is many orders of magnitude brigther, faster and
% more coherent that existing X-ray light sources. Such revolutionary  change is
% almost certain to be accompanied by a range of new experiments that were
% previously unfeasible.

% One important class of such experiments is ultrafast coherent X-ray diffractive
% imaging (CXDI). In such an experiment an extremely bright and very fast X-ray pulse is
% focused on a sample. The sample is quickly vaporized, but not before scattering
% sufficient light for a diffraction pattern to be recorded. The pattern can then
% be phased and the structure of the undamaged sample recovered.

% This thesis presents the results of some of the first ultrafast X-ray diffractive imaging experiments
% are presented. It combines experiments made using both linear accelerator-driven
% free-electron lasers, and optically driven table-top X-ray lasers. It also
% theoretically explores the possibility of investigating phase transitions in
% crystals using X-ray lasers.

% An important problem with ultrafast CXDI of small samples such as proteins is
% that the signal from a measurement is very small, making the pattern
% uninterpretable. So averaging over multiple equivalent samples will be
% necessary. We present a numerical investigation of the problems introduced when
% the samples are not exactly identical and propose some tentative solutions.

% Hawk, a software package for processing and reconstruction of patterns
% obtained in CXDI experiments is introduced. Currently there is no publicly
% available software for this purpose and we hope Hawk fills this gap. It is
% essential that the rapid progresses in terms of experimental hardware are
% accompanied by equivalent developments on the software side otherwise soon we
% will have much more data that what can be analyzed, and Hawk is released as open
% source with the aspiration of fostering such development.
X-ray lasers are creating unprecedented research opportunities in physics,
chemistry and biology. The peak brightness of these lasers exceeds present
synchrotrons by $10^{10}$, the coherence degeneracy parameters exceed
synchrotrons by $10^9$, and the time resolution is $10^5$ times better. In the
duration of a single flash, the beam focused to a micron-sized spot has the same
power density as all the sunlight hitting the Earth, focused to a millimetre
square. 



Ultrafast coherent X-ray diffractive imaging (CXDI) with X-ray lasers exploits
these unique properties of X-ray lasers to obtain high-resolution structures for
non-crystalline biological (and other) objects. In such an experiment, the
sample is quickly vaporised, but not before sufficient scattered light can be
recorded. The continuous diffraction pattern can then be phased and the
structure of a more or less undamaged sample recovered (speed of light vs. speed
of a shock wave). 



This thesis presents results from the first ultrafast X-ray diffractive imaging
experiments with linear accelerator-driven free-electron lasers and from
optically-driven table-top X-ray lasers. It also explores the possibility of
investigating phase transitions in crystals by X-ray lasers. 



An important problem with ultrafast CXDI of small samples such as single protein
molecules is that the signal from a single measurement will be small, requiring
signal enhancement by averaging over multiple equivalent samples. We present a
numerical investigation of the problems, including the case where sample
molecules are not exactly identical, and propose tentative solutions. 



A new software package (HAWK) has been developed for data processing and image
reconstruction. HAWK is the first publicly available software package in this
area, and it is released as an open source software with the aspiration of
fostering the development of this field.
