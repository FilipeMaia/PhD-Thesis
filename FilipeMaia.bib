@article{Levi1984Image,
    abstract = {The method of projections onto convex sets can be used to solve many problems in image restoration, e.g., restoration from phase, spectral extrapolation, and signal recovery in computer-aided tomography. However, image-restoration problems involving nonconvex constraints cannot be handled by the method of projection onto convex sets in a fashion that ensures convergence. The restoration-from-magnitude (RFM) problem is such a case. To handle the RFM as well as other nonconvex constraints, we describe an algorithm known as generalized projections and discuss its properties. When sets are nonconvex, it is possible for the algorithm to exhibit pathological behavior that is never manifest in convex projections. We introduce an error criterion called the summed-distance error (SDE) and show under what circumstances the SDE is a monotonically decreasing function of the number of iterations. Near-optimum performance of the algorithm is achieved by relaxation parameters. Comparisons with other RFM methods are furnished for synthetic imagery.},

Within the first laser period after ionization there is a significant probability that the electron will return to the vicinity of the ion with very high kinetic energy. High-harmonic generation, multiphoton two-electron ejection, and very high energy above-threshold-ionization electrons are all conssequences of this electron-ion interaction. One important parameter which determines the strength of these effects is the rate at which the wave packet spreads in the direction perpendicular to the laser electric field; another is the polarization of the laser. It will be essential for experimentalists to be aware of these crucial parameters in future experiments.},

The theory is valid for arbitrary atomic potentials and can be generalized to describe laser fields of arbitrary ellipticity and spectrum. We discuss the role of atomic dipole matrix elements, electron rescattering processes, and of depletion of the ground state. We present the exact quantum-mechanical formula for the harmonic cutoff that differs from the phenomenological law  I p +3.17 U p , where  I p  is the atomic ionization potential and  U p  is the ponderomotive energy, due to the account for quantum tunneling and diffusion effects.},

@article{Howells2009Assessment,
    abstract = {X-ray diffraction microscopy (XDM) is a new form of X-ray imaging that is being practiced at several third-generation synchrotron-radiation X-ray facilities. Nine years have elapsed since the technique was first introduced and it has made rapid progress in demonstrating high-resolution three-dimensional imaging and promises few-nanometer resolution with much larger samples than can be imaged in the transmission electron microscope. Both life- and materials-science applications of XDM are intended, and it is expected that the principal limitation to resolution will be radiation damage for life science and the coherent power of available X-ray sources for material science. In this paper we address the question of the role of radiation damage. We use a statistical analysis based on the so-called  ” dose fractionation theorem” of Hegerl and Hoppe to calculate the dose needed to make an image of a single life-science sample by XDM with a given resolution. We find that the needed dose scales with the inverse fourth power of the resolution and present experimental evidence to support this finding. To determine the maximum tolerable dose we have assembled a number of data taken from the literature plus some measurements of our own which cover ranges of resolution that are not well covered otherwise. The conclusion of this study is that, based on the natural contrast between protein and water and  ” Rose-criterion” image quality, one should be able to image a frozen-hydrated biological sample using XDM at a resolution of about 10 nm.},

This relationship involves, in general, the location of the zeros of the degree of coherence in the lower half of the complex t plane. It is suggested that the analytic continuation of the temporal degree of coherence of many spectral distributions has no zeros at all in this half plane. The spectral profiles of such distributions could be uniquely determined from measurements of|g(t)| alone. This possibility is of interest in connection with Michelson's well-known method of visibility curves. It is also of interest in connection with the recently proposed correlation and coincidence techniques (employing square-law detection) for determining narrow spectral profiles, such as those found in the output from an optical maser.},

The method does not suffer any of the physical constraints, convergence problems, or defocus ambiguities that often arise in conventional phase-retrieval diffractive imaging techniques. Calculation times are about a thousand times shorter than in current iterative algorithms. We need no  a priori  knowledge about the object, which can be a transmission function with both modulus and phase components.

@article{Beazley2003Automated,
    abstract = {Scripting languages such as Python and Tcl are a powerful tool for the construction of flexible scientific software because they provide scientists with an interpreted problem solving environment and they provide a modular framework for controlling software components written in C, C++, and Fortran. However, a common problem faced by the developers of a scripted scientific application is that of integrating compiled code with an interpreter. To solve this problem, an extensible compiler, simplified wrapper and interface generator (SWIG), has been developed to automate the task of integrating compiled code with scripting language interpreters. SWIG requires no modifications to existing code and uses existing source to create bindings for nine different target languages including Python, Perl, Tcl, Ruby, Guile, and Java. By automating language integration, SWIG enables scientists to use scripting languages at all stages of software development and allows existing software to be more easily integrated into a scripting environment. Although SWIG has been in use for more than 6 years, little has been published on its design and the underlying mechanisms that make it work. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to cover these topics.},

@article{Elser2003Phase,
    abstract = {Several strategies in phase retrieval are unified by an iterative \&quot;difference map\&quot; constructed from a pair of elementary projections and three real parameters. For the standard application in optics, where the two projections implement Fourier modulus and object support constraints, respectively, the difference map reproduces the \&quot;hybrid\&quot; form of Fienup's input\&\#150;output map when a particular choice is made for two of the parameters. The geometric construction of the difference map illuminates the distinction between its fixed points and the recovered object, as well as the mechanism whereby the form of stagnation encountered by alternating projection schemes is avoided. When support constraints are replaced by object histogram or atomicity constraints, the difference map lends itself to crystallographic phase retrieval. Numerical experiments with synthetic data suggest that structures with hundreds of atoms can be solved. \&copy;2003 Optical Society of America},

The images of the freeze-dried cell, obtained by using 750-eV x-rays from different angular orientations, portray several of the cell's major internal components to 30-nm resolution. The good agreement among the independently recovered structures demonstrates the accuracy of the imaging technique. To obtain the best possible reconstructions, we have implemented procedures for handling noisy and incomplete diffraction data, and we propose a method for determining the reconstructed resolution. This work represents a previously uncharacterized application of x-ray diffraction microscopy to a specimen of this complexity and provides confidence in the feasibility of the ultimate goal of imaging biological specimens at 10-nm resolution in three dimensions.},

It works ab initio on high-resolution X-ray diffraction data in the manner of Fourier recycling. The real-space modification simply changes the sign of charge density below a threshold, while in reciprocal space the moduli Fobs are retained resulting in an Fobs map without weighting. The algorithm is tested using synthetic data for a wide range of structures, the solution statistics are analysed and the quality of reconstruction is checked. Finally, mathematical aspects of the algorithm are considered in detail, and these show that in this chaotic iteration process the solution is a limit cycle and not a fixed point.},

It is therefore unnecessary to oversample the magnitude of Fourier transforms by 2× in each dimension (i.e., oversampling by 4× for 2D and 8× for 3D) in retrieving the phase of 2D and 3D objects. Our computer phasing experiments accurately retrieved the phase from the magnitude of the Fourier transforms of 2D and 3D complex-valued objects by using positivity constraints on the imaginary part of the objects and loose supports, with the oversampling factor much less than 4 for 2D and 8 for 3D objects. Under the same conditions we also obtained reasonably good reconstructions of 2D and 3D complex-valued objects from the magnitude of their Fourier transforms with added noise and a central stop.},

Recently we identified two important methods for phase retrieval, namely, Fienup's basic input-output and hybrid input-output (HIO) algorithms, with classical convex projection methods and suggested that further connections between convex optimization and phase retrieval should be explored. Following up on this work, we introduce a new projection-based method, termed the hybrid projection-reflection (HPR) algorithm, for solving phase-retrieval problems featuring nonnegativity constraints in the object domain. Motivated by properties of the HPR algorithm for convex constraints, we recommend an error measure studied by Fienup more than 20 years ago. This error measure, which has received little attention in the literature, lends itself to an easily implementable stopping criterion. In numerical experiments we found the HPR algorithm to be a competitive alternative to the HIO algorithm and the stopping criterion to be reliable and robust.},

@article{Maia2009Structural,
    abstract = {X-ray lasers may allow structural studies on single particles and biomolecules without crystalline periodicity in the samples. We examine here the effect of sample dynamics as a source of structural heterogeneity on the resolution of the reconstructed image of a small protein molecule. Structures from molecular-dynamics simulations of lysozyme were sampled and aligned. These structures were then used to calculate diffraction patterns corresponding to different dynamic states. The patterns were incoherently summed and the resulting data set was phased using the oversampling method. Reconstructed images of hydrated and dehydrated lysozyme gave resolutions of  3.7\^{a}€'\~{A}…  and  7.6\^{a}€'\~{A}… , respectively. These are significantly worse than the root-mean-square deviation of the hydrated ( 2.7\^{a}€'\~{A}…  for all atoms and  1.45\^{a}€'\~{A}…  for  C- \^{I}±  positions) or dehydrated ( 3.7\^{a}€'\~{A}…  for all atoms and  2.5\^{a}€'\~{A}…  for  C- \^{I}±  positions) structures. The noise introduced by structural dynamics and incoherent addition of dissimilar structures restricts the maximum resolution to be expected from direct image reconstruction of dynamic systems. A way of potentially reducing this effect is by grouping dynamic structures into distinct structural substates and solving them separately.},

@article{NeTeDuaneLoh2009Reconstruction,
    abstract = {We introduce the EMC algorithm for reconstructing a particle's three-dimensional (3D) diffraction intensity from very many photon shot-noise limited two-dimensional measurements, when the particle orientation in each measurement is unknown. The algorithm combines a maximization step (M) of the intensity's likelihood function, with expansion (E) and compression (C) steps that map the 3D intensity model to a redundant tomographic representation and back again. After a few iterations of the EMC update rule, the reconstructed intensity is given to the difference-map algorithm for reconstruction of the particle contrast. We demonstrate reconstructions with simulated data and investigate the effects of particle complexity, number of measurements, and the number of photons per measurement. The relatively transparent scaling behavior of our algorithm provides an estimate of the data processing resources required for future single-particle imaging experiments.},

    abstract = {The results of X-ray structure analysis of metmyoglobin at 300 K, 185 K, 165 K, 115 K and 80 K are reported. The lattice vectors a and b decrease linearly with temperature while c shows non-linearity above 180 K, indicating some type of phase transition. Cooling does change the myoglobin structure but only within the structural distribution as determined by individual (chi 2)-values at room temperature. Two residues showed significant alternative positions for side-chains at higher temperatures while only one position is occupied at low temperatures. In the case of LEU 61 a jump between different positions of the side-chain reduces the potential barrier for the entrance of the O2 molecule to the heme pocket. The mean square displacements, (chi 2), of the individual residues decrease linearly with temperature in most cases, indicating a parabolic envelope for the potential responsible for motions. A separation of rotational and translational disorder of the entire molecule is discussed. Comparison with M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy indicates that protein dynamics on a time scale faster than 10(-7) s is not simply a harmonic process. Extrapolation of the structural distributions to T = 0 K shows that a large zero point distribution of the myoglobin structure exists, thus proving that there is no absolute energy minimum for one well defined conformation.},

Using a new approach, we demonstrate the recovery of the structure of a weakly scattering macromolecule at the anticipated next-generation X-ray source intensities. Our work closes a critical gap in determining the structure of single molecules and nanoparticles by X-ray methods, and opens the way to reconstructing the structure of spinning, or randomly oriented objects at extremely low signal levels.},

@article{Huldt2003Diffraction,
    abstract = {Theory predicts that with a very short and very intense X-ray pulse, the image of a single diffraction pattern may be recorded from a large macromolecule, a virus, or a nanocluster of proteins without the need for a crystal. A three-dimensional data set can be assembled from such images when many copies of the molecule are exposed to the beam one by one in random orientations. We outline a method for structure reconstruction from such a data set in which no independent information is available about the orientation of the images. The basic requirement for reconstruction and/or signal averaging is the ability to tell whether two noisy diffraction patterns represent the same view of the sample or two different views. With this knowledge, averaging techniques can be used to enhance the signal and extend the resolution in a redundant data set. Based on statistical properties of the diffraction pattern, we present an analytical solution to the classification problem. The solution connects the number of incident X-ray photons with the particle size and the achievable resolution. The results are surprising in that they show that classification can be done with less than one photon per pixel in the limiting resolution shell, assuming Poisson-type photon noise in the image. The results can also be used to provide criteria for improvements in other image classification procedures, e.g., those used in electron tomography or diffraction.},

@article{Spoel2008Structural,
    abstract = {Ultrafast structural studies of laser-induced melting have demonstrated that the solid-liquid phase transition can take place on a picosecond time scale in a variety of materials. Experimental studies using \r{a}ngstr\"{o}m wavelength X-rays from the sub-picosecond pulse source at Stanford (now retired) on non-thermal melting of semi-conductors, such as indium antimonide, employed the decay of a single Bragg-peak to measure the time component of the phase transition. These materials were found to start melting within one picosecond after the laser pulse. Recent computer simulations have described the thermal melting of ice induced by an infrared laser pulse. Here it was shown that melting can happen within a few picoseconds, somewhat slower than non-thermal melting in semi-conductors. These computer simulations are compatible with spectroscopy experiments on ice-melting, demonstrating that simulations form a very powerful complement to experiments targeting the process of phase-transitions. Here we present an overview of recent experimental and theoretical studies of melting, as well as new simulations of ice-melting where the effect of the size of the crystal on scattering is studied. Based on simulations of a near-macroscopic crystal, we predict the decay of the most intense Bragg peaks of ice following heating by laser pulse, by modeling the scattering from the melting sample in the simulations.},

They were designed using the lead compound 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 -prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2), which is a natural product with demonstrated inhibitory efficiency for this system. First, the binding mode of PGJ2 to NF-κB was unraveled by GOLD docking calculation. Subsequently, substitutions were made to PGJ2 to optimize its association with NF-κB. Care was taken not to strongly increase the reactivity of the new compounds, and to keep the overall shape, size and hydrophilicity of the lead compound, which should render them a similar bioavailability. Molecular mechanics calculations were performed to decide on the suitability of the substitutions, and to evaluate the energies of association with NF-κB. Density functional theory calculations were performed also to study the overall reactivity of the substituted drugs towards NF-κB. Important general conclusions were obtained, concerning the improvement of these natural inhibitors; namely, a set of rational methodologies were deduced to improve the association between the PGJ2 derivatives and NF-κB, and their efficiency demonstrated by generating a set of substituted complexes, some of them with a very much increased affinity for NF-κB, opening new doors to enlarge the therapeutic capabilities of this class of drugs.},

@article{Fernandes2004Design,
    abstract = {In this work we derived a series of new inhibitors for the association between nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and the corresponding κB site in DNA. They were derived through optimization of the lead compound 2-cyclopentenone (CP), which corresponds to the reactive unit of natural product 15-Deoxy-Δ 12,14 -prostaglandin J 2  (PGJ2). Both CP and PGJ2 possess demonstrated inhibitory efficiency for this and other biological important systems. We began by studying the docking of CP to NF-κB. Subsequently, a set of rational strategies were derived to insert substituents into CP which increase its association to NF-κB, in terms of both the affinity and the specificity. Molecular mechanics calculations have been performed to decide on the suitability of the substitutions, and to evaluate the energies of association with NF-κB. One of the important chemical properties of CP is that it is a weak electrophile, hence it selects attacking nucleophilic sites in proteins, rather than the nucleic acids. To assure that the designed compounds were not substantially more reactive than CP we performed high level density functional theory calculations. Important conclusions have been obtained concerning the optimization of this inhibitor; namely, a set of methodologies for rational drug design have been derived to enhance the affinity of the CP derivatives to NF-κB. The efficacy of these methodologies has been demonstrated by generating a set of substituted CPs, exhibiting increased affinity for NF-κB, and opening new ways to broaden the therapeutic applications of this class of drugs.},

Transthyretin is a plasma protein involved in the transport of thyroxine (T4) and also implicated in amyloid diseases. Using competition-binding studies with the protein natural ligand T4, we have identified one prenylated xanthone with a very strong affinity to transthyretin.

    abstract = {Detailed structural investigations on living cells are problematic because existing structural methods cannot reach high resolutions on non-reproducible objects. Illumination with an ultrashort and extremely bright X-ray pulse can outrun key damage processes over a very short period. This can be exploited to extend the diffraction signal to the highest possible resolution in flash diffraction experiments. Here we present an analysis of the interaction of a very intense and very short X-ray pulse with a living cell, using a non-equilibrium population kinetics plasma code with radiation transfer. Each element in the evolving plasma is modeled by numerous states to monitor changes in the atomic populations as a function of pulse length, wavelength, and fluence. The model treats photoionization, impact ionization, Auger decay, recombination, and inverse bremsstrahlung by solving rate equations in a self-consistent manner and describes hydrodynamic expansion through the ion sound speed. The results show that subnanometer resolutions could be reached on micron-sized cells in a diffraction-limited geometry at wavelengths between 0510122 in less than 10\&\#160;fs. Subnanometer resolutions could also be achieved with harder X-rays at higher fluences. We discuss experimental and computational strategies to obtain depth information about the object in flash diffraction experiments.},

It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method.

@article{Lindahl2001GROMACS,
    abstract = {GROMACS 3.0 is the latest release of a versatile and very well optimized package for molecular simulation. Much effort has been devoted to achieving extremely high performance on both workstations and parallel computers. The design includes an extraction of virial and periodic boundary conditions from the loops over pairwise interactions, and special software routines to enable rapid calculation of x-1/2. Inner loops are generated automatically in C or Fortran at compile time, with optimizations adapted to each architecture. Assembly loops using SSE and 3DNow! Multimedia instructions are provided for x86 processors, resulting in exceptional performance on inexpensive PC workstations. The interface is simple and easy to use (no scripting language), based on standard command line arguments with self-explanatory functionality and integrated documentation. All binary files are independent of hardware endian and can be read by versions of GROMACS compiled using different floating-point precision. A large collection of flexible tools for trajectory analysis is included, with output in the form of finished Xmgr/Grace graphs. A basic trajectory viewer is included, and several external visualization tools can read the GROMACS trajectory format. Starting with version 3.0, GROMACS is available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.gromacs.org.},

@article{Patriksson2007Protein,
    abstract = {Abstract: During electrospray ionization (ESI), proteins are transferred from solution into vacuum, a process that influences the conformation of the protein. Exactly how much the conformation changes due to the dehydration process, and in what way, is difficult to determine experimentally. The aim of this study is therefore to monitor what happens to protein structures as the surrounding waters gradually evaporate, using computer simulations of the transition of proteins from water to vacuum. Five different proteins have been simulated with water shells of varying thickness, enabling us to mimic the entire dehydration process. We find that all protein structures are affected, at least to some extent, by the transfer but that the major features are preserved. A water shell with a thickness of roughly two molecules is enough to emulate bulk water and to largely maintain the solution phase structure. The conformations obtained in vacuum are quite similar and make up an ensemble which differs from the structure obtained by experimental means, and from the solution phase structure as found in simulations. Dehydration forces the protein to make more intramolecular hydrogen bonds, at the expense of exposing more hydrophobic area (to vacuum). Native hydrogen bonds usually persist in vacuum, yielding an easy route to refolding upon rehydration. The findings presented here are promising for future bio-imaging experiments with X-ray free electron lasers, and they strongly support the validity of mass spectrometry experiments for studies of intra- and intermolecular interactions.},

In the saturation regime, the peak energy approached 170 J for individual pulses, and the average energy per pulse reached 70 J. The pulse duration was in the region of 10 fs, and peak powers of 10 GW were achieved. At a pulse repetition frequency of 700 pulses per second, the average extreme-ultraviolet power reached 20 mW. The output beam also contained a significant contribution from odd harmonics of approximately 0.6\% and 0.03\% for the 3rd (4.6 nm) and the 5th (2.75 nm) harmonics, respectively. At 2.75 nm the 5th harmonic of the radiation reaches deep into the water window, a wavelength range that is crucially important for the investigation of biological samples.},

This is of interest in the context of diffraction and imaging using X-rays, where radiation damage is the main limiting factor for achieving high resolution data. Here we present new results on electron-induced damage on liquid water and ice, from the simulation of Auger electron cascades. We have compared our theoretical estimations to the available experimental data on elastic and inelastic electron–molecule interactions for water and found the theoretical results for elastic cross-sections to be in very good agreement with experiment. As a result of the cascade we find that the average number of secondary electrons after 100 fs in ice is about 25, slightly higher than in water, where it is about 20. The difference in damage between ice and water is discussed in the context of sample handling for biomolecular systems.},

Theresults suggest that by using ultrashort exposures, structuralinformation may be collected before the sample is destroyed due toradiation damage. In this paper a method is presented to include theeffect of screening by free electrons in the sample in a moleculardynamics simulation. The electrons are approximated by a classical gas,and the electron distribution is calculated iteratively from thePoisson-Boltzmann equation. Test simulations of water clusters revealthe details of the explosion dynamics, as well as the evolution of thefree electron gas during the beam exposure. We find that inclusion ofthe electron gas in the model slows down the Coulomb explosion. Thehydrogen atoms leave the sample faster than the oxygen atoms, leading toa double layer of positive ions. A considerable electron density islocated between these two layers. The fact that the hydrogens are foundto explode much faster than the oxygens means that the diffracting partof the sample stays intact somewhat longer than the sample as a whole.},

@article{Persson2001Shakeup,
    abstract = {Photoionization of an atom by X-rays usually removes an inner shell electron from the atom, leaving behind a perturbed "hollow ion" whose relaxation may take different routes. In light elements, emission of an Auger electron is common. However, the energy and the total number of electrons released from the atom may be modulated by shake-up and shake-off effects. When the inner shell electron leaves, the outer shell electrons may find themselves in a state that is not an eigen-state of the atom in its surroundings. The resulting collective excitation is called shake-up. If this process also involves the release of low energy electrons from the outer shell, then the process is called shake-off. It is not clear how significant shake-up and shake-off contributions are to the overall ionization of biological materials like proteins. In particular, the interaction between the outgoing electron and the remaining system depends on the chemical environment of the atom, which can be studied by quantum chemical methods. Here we present calculations on model compounds to represent the most common chemical environments in proteins. The results show that the shake-up and shake-off processes affect approximately 20\% of all emissions from nitrogen, 30\% from carbon, 40\% from oxygen, and 23\% from sulfur. Triple and higher ionizations are rare for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, but are frequent for sulfur. The findings are relevant to the design of biological experiments at emerging X-ray free-electron lasers.},

    abstract = {Abstract.\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Many scientific disciplines ranging from physics, chemistry and biology to material sciences, geophysics and medical diagnostics need a powerful X-ray source with pulse lengths in the femtosecond range\&nbsp;[1-4]. This would allow, for example, time-resolved observation of chemical reactions with atomic resolution. Such radiation of extreme intensity, and tunable over a wide range of wavelengths, can be accomplished using high-gain free-electron lasers (FEL)\&nbsp;[5-10]. Here we present results of the first successful operation of an FEL at a wavelength of 32\&nbsp;nm, with ultra-short pulses (25\&nbsp;fs FWHM), a peak power at the Gigawatt level, and a high degree of transverse and longitudinal coherence. The experimental data are in full agreement with theory. This is the shortest wavelength achieved with an FEL to date and an important milestone towards a user facility designed for wavelengths down to 6\&nbsp;nm. With a peak brilliance exceeding the state-of-the-art of synchrotron radiation sources\&nbsp;[4] by seven orders of magnitude, this device opens a new field of experiments, and it paves the way towards sources with even shorter wavelengths, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source\&nbsp;[3] at Stanford, USA, and the European X-ray Free Electron Laser Facility\&nbsp;[4] in Hamburg, Germany.},

    abstract = {Sample damage by X-rays and other radiation limits the resolution of
structural studies on non-repetitive and non-reproducible structures
such as individual biomolecules or cells. Cooling can slow sample
deterioration, but cannot eliminate damage-induced sample movement
during the time needed for conventional measurements. Analyses of the
dynamics of damage formation suggest that the conventional damage
barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per \&\#197;<SUP>2</SUP> with X-rays of
12keV energy or 1\&\#197; wavelength) may be extended at very high dose
rates and very short exposure times. Here we have used computer
simulations to investigate the structural information that can be
recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by
single protein molecules and small assemblies. Estimations of radiation
damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse
intensity and sample size show that experiments using very high X-ray
dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural
information before radiation damage destroys the sample. We predict that
such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers
that are currently under development, in combination with container-free
sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new
approach to structural determinations with X-rays.},

However, in their numerical modelling of the Coulomb explosion, several interactions were neglected and no reconstruction of the atomic structure was given. In this work we carried out improved molecular-dynamics calculations including all quantum processes which affect the explosion. Based on this time evolution, we generated composite elastic-scattering patterns, and by using Fienup's algorithm successfully reconstructed the original atomic structure.

@article{Bortel2007Classification,
    abstract = {The very intense and short pulses of future X-ray free electron lasers may allow the atomic resolution imaging of small, non-periodic objects. Preliminary estimates show that images obtained from single pulses do not contain statistically enough photons to allow successful reconstruction. Therefore multiple exposures of randomly oriented identical replicas have to be taken and the individual images have to be classified according to the object\&\#x2019;s orientation. The classification has been analytically treated by Huldt et al. [Huldt, G., Szoke, A., Hajdu, J., 2003. J. Struct. Biol. 144, 219.]. In this paper we extend the analytical results with numerical model calculations. This allows us to simulate realistic situations, which we will face in real experiments. We find significant deviations from the analytical expectations, even in the ideal case of spherical particles with random atomic distributions. We introduce a new norm for the individual scattering patterns and describe a criterion to select images belonging to similar orientation, which makes the classification more reliable in practice. We also discuss the effects of particle shape and size, partial orientational ordering, the measurement\&\#x2019;s resolution and the charge error caused by the Coulomb explosion.},

@article{Miao2000Possible,
    abstract = {It is known that sampling the diffraction pattern of a finite specimen, at a spacing somewhat finer than the Nyquist spacing (the inverse of the size of the diffracting specimen), corresponds to generating a no-density region surrounding the electron density of the specimen. This no-density region can then be used to retrieve the phase information. In earlier papers [Miao, Sayre \& Chapman (1998). J. Opt. Soc. Am. A15, 1662-1669; Sayre, Chapman \& Miao (1998). Acta Cryst. A54, 232-239], it was demonstrated, in the case of non-crystalline specimens, that this no-density region could be used to retrieve the phase information; here the same is performed for crystalline and near-crystalline specimens. By employment of an iterative algorithm, the phase information could be recovered from computer-generated oversampled diffraction patterns of small specimens that are (a) perfect or imperfect crystals, or (b) have a repeated motif without orientational regularity, or (c) are an unrepeated motif, such as an amorphous glass, a single molecule or a single biological cell. Cases (a) and (b) represent an extension over work recently published [Miao, Charalambous, Kirz \& Sayre (1999). Nature (London), 400, 342-344]. Our algorithm requires an approximate envelope for the specimen. It does not require any structural knowledge concerning the specimen and does not require data to atomic resolution (although it can use such data if present). After a few hundred to a few thousand iterations, the correct phase set and image are recovered. The oversampling technique thus greatly extends the specimen range of X-ray crystallography but it imposes a high radiation dose on the specimens compared with the situation in crystallography, in which it is usual for the pattern to be sampled at the (much less fine) Bragg spacing (the inverse of the size of the unit cell). In cases where the specimen is a crystal, there are also possibilities for oversampling relative to Bragg (instead of Nyquist) sampling, thus providing a lesser degree of oversampling and the possibility of lower dosage. Damage of the specimen in consequence of the dose will in many cases seriously affect the quality and resolution of the imaging, but in at least one case [the biological cell in (c) above] the imaging obtainable with the aid of a cryogenic protective technique should surpass any other present method of whole-cell imaging. In addition, with the possible appearance in the future of free electron lasers (>10(12) photons and <200 fs per pulse), it is possible to circumvent the radiation-damage problem by recording diffraction patterns before damage manifests itself.},

It is shown that a simulated molecular diffraction pattern at 2.5-A resolution accumulated from multiple copies of single rubisco biomolecules, each generated by a femtosecond-level x-ray free electron laser pulse, can be successfully phased and transformed into an accurate electron density map comparable to that obtained by more conventional methods. The phase problem is solved by using an iterative algorithm with a random phase set as an initial input. The convergence speed of the algorithm is reasonably fast, typically around a few hundred iterations. This approach and phasing method do not require any ab initio information about the molecule, do not require an extended ordered lattice array, and can tolerate high noise and some missing intensity data at the center of the diffraction pattern. With the prospects of the x-ray free electron lasers, this approach could provide a major new opportunity for the high-resolution three-dimensional structure determination of single biomolecules.},

By employing an iterative algorithm, the phase information from the oversampled diffraction pattern of a micrometre-sized test specimen has been successfully retrieved.

    abstract = {The two-dimensional (2D) Self-Organizing Map (SOM) has a well-known \&\#x201c;border effect\&\#x201d;. Several spherical SOMs which use lattices of the tessellated icosahedron have been proposed to solve this problem. However, existing data structures for such SOMs are either not space efficient or are time consuming when searching the neighborhood. We introduce a 2D rectangular grid data structure to store the icosahedron-based geodesic dome. Vertices relationships are maintained by their positions in the data structure rather than by immediate neighbor pointers or an adjacency list. Increasing the number of neurons can be done efficiently because the overhead caused by pointer updates is reduced. Experiments show that the spherical SOM using our data structure, called a GeoSOM, runs with comparable speed to the conventional 2D SOM. The GeoSOM also reduces data distortion due to removal of the boundaries. Furthermore, we developed an interface to project the GeoSOM onto the 2D plane using a cartographic approach, which gives users a global view of the spherical data map. Users can change the center of the 2D data map interactively. In the end, we compare the GeoSOM to the other spherical SOMs by space complexity and time complexity.},

Latent variable models represent the probability density of data in a space of several dimensions in terms of a smaller number of latent, or hidden, variables. A familiar example is factor analysis which is based on a linear transformations between the latent space and the data space. In this paper we introduce a form of non-linear latent variable model called the Generative Topographic Mapping for which the parameters of the model can be determined using the EM algorithm. GTM provides a principled alternative to the widely used Self-Organizing Map (SOM) of Kohonen (1982), and overcomes most of the significant limitations of the SOM. We demonstrate the performance of the GTM algorithm on a toy problem and on simulated data from flow diagnostics for a multi-phase oil pipeline. GTM: The Generative Topographic Mapping 2},

The reconstruction reveals the coat protein arrangement and variations in stain distribution inside the virus core. Selection rules imposed by the spherical symmetry on the harmonic expansion component are obtained indeed for angular momenta,  l , lower than 11, but cannot be shown for  l ≥11, due to non-spherical distortions of about 1/11th of the radius of the virus. This prevents us from resolving fine details of packing of the protomers on the surface lattice.

@article{Saldin2009Structure,
    abstract = {Amongst the promised capabilities of fourth-generation x-ray sources currently under construction is the ability to record diffraction patterns from individual biological molecules. One version of such an experiment would involve directing a stream of molecules into the x-ray beam and sequentially recording the scattering from each molecule of a short, but intense, pulse of radiation. The pulses are sufficiently short that the diffraction pattern is that due to scattering from identical molecules 'frozen' in random orientations. Each diffraction pattern may be thought of as a section through the 3D reciprocal space of the molecule, of unknown, random, orientation. At least two algorithms have been proposed for finding the relative orientations from just the measured diffraction data. The 'common-line' method, also employed in 3D electron microscopy, appears not best suited to the very low mean photon count per diffraction pattern pixel expected in such experiments. A manifold embedding technique has been used to reconstruct the 3D diffraction volume and hence the electron density of a small protein at the signal level expected of the scattering of an x-ray free electron laser pulse from a 500 kD biomolecule. In this paper, we propose an alternative algorithm which raises the possibility of reconstructing the 3D diffraction volume of a molecule without determining the relative orientations of the individual diffraction patterns. We discuss why such an algorithm may provide a practical and computationally convenient method of extracting information from very weak diffraction patterns. We suggest also how such a method may be adapted to the problem of finding the variations of a structure with time in a time-resolved pump-probe experiment.},

    abstract = {Single molecule imaging experiments at future X-ray free electron laser sources will provide large number of random 3D oriented diffraction patterns with low counting statistics. Grouping of this vast amount of data into classes of similar orientations and averaging must be performed before their orientation and structure reconstruction can take place. Classification algorithms performing all-pair pattern comparisons scale badly with the number of patterns in terms of their computing requirements, which presents a problem in case of improving resolution and decreasing signal to noise ratios. We describe an algorithm performing significantly less pattern comparisons and render classification possible in such cases. The invariance of patterns against rotation of the object about the primary beam axis is also exploited to decrease the number of classes and improve the quality of class averages. This work is the first, which demonstrates that it is possible to classify a dataset with realistic target parameters: 10 keV photon energy, 10 12  photons/pulse, 100 × 100 nm 2  focusing, 538 kDa protein, 2.4 \r{A} resolution, 10 6  patterns,  3 × 10 4  classes, <1° misorientation within classes.

@article{Shapiro2008Powder,
    abstract = {Atomic resolution structures from small proteins have recently been
determined from high quality powder diffraction patterns using a combination of
stereochemical restraints and Rietveld refinement (Von Dreele, 2007,
Margiolaki, 2007). While powder diffraction data has been obtained from batch
samples of small crystal-suspensions, which are exposed to x-rays for long
periods of time and undergo significant radiation damage, we show the
proof-of-concept that protein powder diffraction data from nano- crystals of a
membrane protein can be obtained using a continuous micro-jet. This flow-
focusing aerojet has been developed to deliver a solution of hydrated protein
nano- crystals to an x-ray beam for diffraction analysis. This method requires
neither the crushing of larger polycrystalline samples nor any techniques to
avoid radiation damage such as cryo-cooling. We have commissioned an apparatus
to record protein powder diffraction in this manner and in this paper present
the first powder diffraction patterns from a membrane protein, photosystem 1,
with crystallite sizes less than 500 nm. These preliminary patterns show the
lowest order reflections, which agree quantitatively with theoretical
calculations of the powder profile. The results also serve to test our aerojet
injector system, with future application to femtosecond diffraction in Free
Electron X-ray Laser schemes, and for Serial Crystallography using a

@article{Chapman2007Femtosecond,
    abstract = {Extremely intense and ultrafast X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers offer unique opportunities to study fundamental aspects of complex transient phenomena in materials. Ultrafast time-resolved methods usually require highly synchronized pulses to initiate a transition and then probe it after a precisely defined time delay. In the X-ray regime, these methods are challenging because they require complex optical systems and diagnostics. Here we propose and apply a simple holographic measurement scheme, inspired by Newton's 'dusty mirror' experiment, to monitor the X-ray-induced explosion of microscopic objects. The sample is placed near an X-ray mirror; after the pulse traverses the sample, triggering the reaction, it is reflected back onto the sample by the mirror to probe this reaction. The delay is encoded in the resulting diffraction pattern to an accuracy of one femtosecond, and the structural change is holographically recorded with high resolution. We apply the technique to monitor the dynamics of polystyrene spheres in intense free-electron-laser pulses, and observe an explosion occurring well after the initial pulse. Our results support the notion that X-ray flash imaging can be used to achieve high resolution, beyond radiation damage limits for biological samples. With upcoming ultrafast X-ray sources we will be able to explore the three-dimensional dynamics of materials at the timescale of atomic motion.},

@article{Barty2008Ultrafast,
    abstract = {The transient nanoscale dynamics of materials on femtosecond to picosecond timescales is of great interest in the study of condensed phase dynamics such as crack formation, phase separation and nucleation, and rapid fluctuations in the liquid state or in biologically relevant environments. The ability to take images in a single shot is the key to studying non-repetitive behaviour mechanisms, a capability that is of great importance in many of these problems. Using coherent diffraction imaging with femtosecond X-ray free-electron-laser pulses we capture time-series snapshots of a solid as it evolves on the ultrafast timescale. Artificial structures imprinted on a Si3N4 window are excited with an optical laser and undergo laser ablation, which is imaged with a spatial resolution of 50 nm and a temporal resolution of 10 ps. By using the shortest available free-electron-laser wavelengths1 and proven synchronization methods2 this technique could be extended to spatial resolutions of a few nanometres and temporal resolutions of a few tens of femtoseconds. This experiment opens the door to a new regime of time-resolved experiments in mesoscopic dynamics.},

@article{Chapman2006Femtosecond,
    abstract = {Theory predicts that, with an ultrashort and extremely bright coherent X-ray pulse, a single diffraction pattern may be recorded from a large macromolecule, a virus or a cell before the sample explodes and turns into a plasma. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of this principle using the FLASH soft-X-ray free-electron laser. An intense 25 fs, 4times1013 W cm-2 pulse, containing 1012 photons at 32 nm wavelength, produced a coherent diffraction pattern from a nanostructured non-periodic object, before destroying it at 60,000 K. A novel X-ray camera assured single-photon detection sensitivity by filtering out parasitic scattering and plasma radiation. The reconstructed image, obtained directly from the coherent pattern by phase retrieval through oversampling shows no measurable damage, and is reconstructed at the diffraction-limited resolution. A three-dimensional data set may be assembled from such images when copies of a reproducible sample are exposed to the beam one by one.},

Powerful algorithms are increasingly being used to act as lenses to form such images. Current image reconstruction methods; however; require the knowledge of the shape of the object and the low spatial frequencies unavoidably lost in experiments. Diffractive imaging has thus previously been used to increase the resolution of images obtained by other means. Here we experimentally demonstrate an inversion method; which reconstructs the image of the object without the need for any such prior knowledge.},
