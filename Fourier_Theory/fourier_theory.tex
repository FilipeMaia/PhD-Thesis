\chapter{An Introduction to Fourier Transforms}\label{fourier_transform_basics}\noindent
Fourier transforms are used extensively in the subject of diffraction and
imaging, so in this chapter we present a basic introduction, describing the
Fourier transform and its most commonly used properties. These properties will
be fundamental for a description of scattering and for the explanation
of image reconstruction algorithms.

\section{Continuous Fourier Transform}

We will start by defining the continuous forward Fourier transform, following crystallographic tradition, as,
\begin{equation}
\hat{f}(q) = \mathscr{F}f = \int \limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} 
f(x) \exp(2 \pi i q \cdot x) \, dx
\end{equation}
and the inverse transform as
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \mathscr{F}^{-1}\hat{f} = \int \limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} 
\hat{f}(q) \exp(-2 \pi i q \cdot x) \, dq.
\end{equation}
The following properties of the Fourier transform will be important for the rest of the thesis:
%The Fourier transform has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Fourier transform is a linear transformation. For any two complex
  numbers $a$ and $b$
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{F}\left\{ a f(x) + b g(x)\right\} = a \mathscr{F}f(x) + b \mathscr{F}g(x)
\end{equation}

\item ``Stretching'' a function ``squeezes'' its Fourier  transform,
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{F}\left\{f(a x)\right\} = \frac{1}{|a|}\hat{f}(\frac{x}{a}) 
\end{equation}
where $a$ is a real number different from zero. This is known as the scaling
property or theorem.

\item The Fourier transform of a real function $f(x)$ is a hermitian function,  
\begin{equation}
\hat{f}(q) = \overline{\hat{f}(-q)}
\end{equation}
where $\overline{\hat{f}(-q)}$ represents the complex conjugate of $\hat{f}(-q)$.
\item The Fourier transform of an hermitian function $f(x)$ is a real function,
\begin{equation}
Im\left[\hat{f}(q)\right] = 0
\end{equation}
where $Im\left[\hat{f}(q)\right]$ represents the imaginary part of $\hat{f}(q)$.
\item The Fourier transform of a function translated by an amount $\Delta x$ is
  related to the transform of the original function by a factor of $\exp(2 \pi i
  \Delta x q)$,
  \begin{equation}
    \mathscr{F} f(x+\Delta x) = \exp(2 \pi i \Delta x q) \mathscr{F} f(x)
\end{equation}

\item The integral of the square of the absolute value of a function and it's Fourier transform are identical
\begin{equation}
\int |\hat{f}(q)|^2 dq = \int |f(x)|^2 dx.
\end{equation}
This is usually known as Parseval's theorem or Rayleigh's energy theorem.

\item The convolution of any two functions is equal to the inverse Fourier transform of the product of the forward Fourier transform of those two functions,
\begin{eqnarray}
f(x) * g(x) & = & \int f(\tau) g(x-\tau) \, d\tau \nonumber \\
& = & \mathscr{F}^{-1}\left\{\mathscr{F}f(x) \times \mathscr{F}g(x)\right\}
\end{eqnarray}
where $f(x) * g(x)$ denotes the convolution of $f(x)$ with $g(x)$. This property
is known as the convolution theorem.

\item The cross-correlation of any two functions is equal to the inverse Fourier
  transform of the product of the forward Fourier transform of one function with
  the complex conjugate of the forward Fourier transform of the other function,
\begin{eqnarray}
f(x) \star g(x) & = & \int f(\tau) g(x+\tau) \, d\tau \nonumber \\ 
& = & \mathscr{F}^{-1}\left\{\mathscr{F}f(x) \times \overline{\mathscr{F}g(x)}\right\}
\end{eqnarray}
where $f(x) \star g(x)$ denotes the cross-correlation of $f(x)$ with $g(x)$.
 
\item Finally the correlation of a function with itself, also known as
  autocorrelation is equal to the inverse Fourier transform of the absolute
  value squared of the forward Fourier transform of that function,
  \begin{eqnarray}
f(x) \star f(x) & = & \mathscr{F}^{-1}\left\{\mathscr{F}f(x) 
  \times \overline{\mathscr{F}f(x)}\right\} \nonumber \\
& = & \mathscr{F}^{-1}\left\{|\mathscr{F}f(x)|^2\right\}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discrete Fourier Transform}

In practice we will be dealing with signals which are not continuous, but
discrete, as most signal recording is done digitally nowadays and to be able to
perform numerical computations with any input we first need to digitize
it. Fortunately there is a discrete analogue of the Fourier transform called
the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The one dimensional discrete Fourier
transform of a vector $\mathbf x$ of length N is defined by
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf x}_k = \mathscr{F}\left\{ \mathbf x\right\}_k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum
\limits_{n=0}^{N} \mathbf x_n \exp\left(2 \pi i k \frac{n}{N}\right) \, ,
\end{equation}
and the inverse pair as
\begin{equation}
{\mathbf x}_n = \mathscr{F}^{-1}\left\{ \mathbf x\right\}_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}} \sum
\limits_{k=0}^{M} \hat{\mathbf x}_k \exp\left(-2 \pi i n \frac{k}{M}\right) \, .
\end{equation}

Throughout this thesis we will commit a slight abuse of notation and use
$\mathscr{F}$ to symbolize both the continuous Fourier transform, when the
operand is a function, and the discrete Fourier transform, when the operand is a
vector.
 
The DFT has properties analogous to most properties of its continuous
counterpart, in particular it's a distance preserving transform, that is the distance between two vectors is the same before and after transformation
\begin{equation}
  |\mathscr{F}(x)-\mathscr{F}(y)| = |(x-y)|
\end{equation}
which follows from both the linearity of the transform and Parseval's theorem.
It also fulfills the convolution theorem if we define the discrete
convolution as
\begin{equation}
  (\mathbf a * \mathbf b)_n = \sum \limits_{m = 0}^{N-1} \mathbf a_m 
  \mathbf  b_{n-m \bmod N} .
  \label{Eq:dft_convolution}
\end{equation}
Notice the modulus $N$ in the index of $b$. This detail will lead to important
consequences.

\section{Sampling and oversampling}


An arbitrary band-limited signal $f(x)$ with bandwidth $2B$, meaning a signal which has
$\hat{f}(x) = 0$ for every $|x| > B$, can be perfectly reconstructed from
the same signal sampled in steps of length smaller or equal to $1/2B$ \cite{Shannon1949Communication}. $2B$ is
known as the {\em Nyquist rate}. This derives from the fact that the continuous
Fourier transform of $f(x)$ can be exactly reconstructed from equidistant samples
separated by a step of length $s < 1/2B$,
\begin{eqnarray}
rect_B(q) & = & 
\begin{cases}
  1  & \text{if $|q| \le B$,}\\
  0  & \text{if $q > B$.}
\end{cases}\\
\text{\Sha}_s(x) & = & \sum_{i = -\infty}^{\infty} \delta(x-i s)\\
\hat{f}(q) & = & \mathscr{F}\{\text{\Sha}_s(x) f(x)\} rect_B(q)
\end{eqnarray}
where $\delta(x)$ represents the Dirac delta function.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9 \columnwidth]{Fourier_Theory/Sampling2.png}
  \caption{Reconstruction of a band-limited signal from discrete samples taken at
    a frequency higher than the Nyquist rate. The signal $f(x)$ is multiplied
    with the sampling function \Sha$(x)$ corresponding to sampling of the signal
    by a pixel detector. This corresponds to replicating the spectrum of the
    signal in Fourier space. Notice that there is no overlap of the replicated
    spectra of the sampled signal in Fourier space (on the right). It is then possible to recover the original signal by selecting the
    original signal with an appropriate rectangular window function
    rect$(q)$. In real space this corresponds to a convolution with the
    corresponding sinc function sinc$(x)$.}
  \label{Fig:Sampling}
\end{figure}

As figure \ref{Fig:Sampling} shows, sampling a signal causes its spectrum to be
replicated in Fourier space. The distance between the replicas is proportional
to the sampling frequency due to the scaling property of the Fourier
transform. If the sampling frequency is below the Nyquist rate the spectra will
overlap and a perfect reconstruction is no longer possible. This phenomenon is known as
aliasing (see Fig. \ref{Fig:Undersampling}) and is related to eq. \ref{Eq:dft_convolution}. We call such a signal {\em undersampled}. If on the other hand
the sampling frequency is higher than the Nyquist rate, we call it {\em
  oversampled} and we define the {\em oversampling ratio}, $\sigma$, as the ratio between the
sampling frequency and the Nyquist rate, or equivalently the fraction between
the center of two replicas of the spectrum in Fourier space and the region for
which the spectrum is different from zero, as illustrated in figure \ref{Fig:OversamplingRatio}.

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \caption{Incomplete recovery of an undersampled band-limited signal leading to
    aliasing. The process is analogous to \ref{Fig:Sampling} but with a sampling
    frequency below the Nyquist rate. 
%    The spectrum of the signal will then overlap in the sampled signal
    The replicated spectra of the undersampled signal overlap with each other in
    Fourier space,
    and a perfect reconstruction is no longer possible.}
